Program Description
====================
The program translates one side of a string with the '=' sign being the delimiter. This is particularly useful in translating files like properties file (See in extra -> modified_messages.properties, with the original file being messages.properties)

Hence, the source can be used for the translation of UI files, where the strings that are displayed in the UI can be translated into one of the languages supported by the software. For the list of languages supported, the user can refer to the 'Supported_Languages' file under 'extra.'

The Client Secret has to be kept... well, secret. Therefore, neither the Client ID nor the Client Secret is there in the source. However, the .class files are fully functional. Users are encouraged to visit the Azure Marketplace and get themselves registered to get their personal ID and Client Secret.

The program is developed using the Bing translation libraries. The API is provided by Microsoft on a non-commercial licence. The free account has a limit of 2 million characters per month. The Java wrapper for the API is provided by :

It is available as a JAR file from the link above. The contents of JAR have been extracted and placed under the directory named 'translation-api.'
